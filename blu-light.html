<p class="Bquote">You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Say what? 

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
Hey, guess what you're accessories to.
Meh.
As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. No, I'm Santa Claus! 
</p>

<p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Say what? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Oh God, what have I done? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I don't want to be rescued.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. You are the last hope of the universe. Now what? I don't want to be rescued. Pansy.
